# deth's userscripts

the scripts that i used in my tampermonkey :)

- [arc URL copy](https://github.com/katzEco/legacy-code/raw/main/userscripts/arc-url-copy.user.js) <br /> This is a script that i made for other browser (like chrome, brave, firefox) to copy link like i copy in `ARC browser` ( but i not really recommend because the browser short key :( )
- [Fast URL copy](https://github.com/katzEco/legacy-code/raw/main/userscripts/fast-url-copy.user.js) <br /> This is a script that i just implement from the above one cause the short key (change from `cmd + shift + c` to `alt + c`)
- [Hide your Screen](https://github.com/katzEco/legacy-code/raw/main/userscripts/hide-screen.user.js) <br /> This is a script to hide everything on your screen ðŸ’¯
